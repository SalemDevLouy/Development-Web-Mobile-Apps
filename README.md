# Welcome to Development-Web-Mobile-Apps Repo!

Hi!  As students of class 2021 in **Web Development & Mobile Application**, we created this repository to share our resources and materials to assist other classes that may come after this year. All the materials are shared on Google Drive and we created this simple HTML website to make it easy to navigate the material. Feel free to contribute with us if you have any ideas.
